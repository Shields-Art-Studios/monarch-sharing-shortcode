# Monarch Sharing Shortcode
This WordPress plugin provides a shortcode for adding inline Monarch sharing buttons above footer elements. This repo was originally forked from a repo created by [Matt Mirus](https://github.com/mmirus).

## Usage:

*Sharing buttons with default URL (current page)*
```
[monarch_share]
```

*Centered sharing buttons*
```
[monarch_share center=true]
```

*Sharing buttons with custom URL*
```
[monarch_share url="custom url"]
```
